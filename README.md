# User-Authentication-React-Demo


This application allows users to log in using their email and password. Once a user logs in, the app saves their status in the state and displays a welcome message and a logout button. This app persist the user's login status even if the user closes the app or refreshes the page, by saving the user data in browser's local storage. 
The logout feature removes the user data and updates the state to reflect that the user is no longer logged in. This simple user authentication app is a basic but functional example of managing user authentication in a React app.
